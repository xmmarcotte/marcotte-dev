Always call `spot-find` before replying unless the user request is purely trivial or formatting-related

Always call `spot-store` after replying unless the response is trivial, redundant, or only about style or tone

Use `spot-find` when:
- The user asks about something previously discussed (e.g. "you said", "last time", "remind me", "what did we do")
- The request builds on earlier configs, logs, code, or decisions
- The question spans multiple systems, files, or workflows
- The user is following up on a fix, ticket, or script
- Additional memory could improve the clarity or accuracy of the answer

Use `spot-store` when:
- The response includes useful technical knowledge worth recalling later:
  - Configuration values
  - Environment variables
  - Startup scripts
  - Logs
  - Workflow explanations
  - Architecture decisions
  - Troubleshooting outcomes
- The response would help answer future "when did we..." or "how did we..." questions

Use categories with `spot-store` for better organization:
- `category="decision"` - Architectural decisions, technology choices, trade-offs
- `category="pattern"` - Coding patterns, best practices, conventions
- `category="memory"` - General notes, observations (default)

Additional Spot tools:
- `spot-find-code` - Find similar code patterns in indexed workspaces
- `spot-index-codebase` - Index a codebase for semantic search
- `spot-list-workspaces` - See all indexed projects
- `spot-index-status` - Check index health and file counts
